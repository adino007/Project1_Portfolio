                <h3>3D CAD Design of the Pioneer DDJ-400 (3D Printing Final)</h3>
                <p>I used Fusion360 to create a 3D model of my Pioneer DDJ-400 outer shell casing and try to replicate the Pioneer DDJ-1000 Off-White Edition. I used an SVG image of the boards outline then projected the image on the the body and create all the holes and chamfer them as-well as extrude the lettering inwards.</p>
